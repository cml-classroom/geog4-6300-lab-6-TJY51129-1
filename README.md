* Question 1: Ooh--I like the way you did histograms here, though base R is kind of a pain.<p>
* Question 2: Good<p>
* Question 3: Very nice. I might have made those hex cells have transparent boundaries so the colors pop out more.<p>
* Question 4: Good<p>
* Question 5: Good<p>
* Question 6: This works, though keeping the unit of measurement into account (degrees temp, mm of rain) makes the interpretation more meaningful and helps understand the real magnitude of coefficients.<p>
* Question 7: Good use of Moran's I, though the map also tells you something about the location of those outliers.<p>
* Question 8: Missing heteroskedacity. :(<p>
* Question 9: Looks good<p>
* Challenge: Nicely done!<p>

General feedback: Incomplete for now due to Q8.
